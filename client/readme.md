# 🌐 Chatr Frontend Client App

This is a Azure Functions app, but it is a companion to the client front end, so should be hosted in [Azure Static Web Apps API support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/apis) rather than a standalone function

[See main readme for details](../readme.md#client--frontend)
